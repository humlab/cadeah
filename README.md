Video Reuse Detector
===

## What is it?

The Video Reuse Detector will allow a user to upload a video and compare
it against a set of other videos, returning a subset of those videos ranked
by their similarity to the uploaded video.

The intention is that a match should be returned even if the source video
has been exposed to some form of an "attack", such as horizontal flipping,
frame rate changes, picture-in-picture, etc.

It does this by computing video fingerprints for all of the  reference
videos, and the input video, and comparing these fingerprints against one
another. It is the fingerprints that "resistant" against these attacks.

## What is the purpose?

The project "European History Reloaded: Circulation and Appropriation of
Digital Audiovisual Heritage" (**CADEAH**)—funded by the European Union's
Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme --- will shed light on how
online users engage with Europe's audiovisual heritage online.

The project is a follow up on the EUscreen projects, and particularly looks
at online circulation and appropriation of audiovisual heritage via the
usage of algorithmic tracking and tracing technologies. The project brings
together scholars and developers from Utrecht University, the Institute of
Contemporary History (Czech Republic) and the digital humanities hub, Humlab
at Umeå University --- and also includes the Netherlands Institute for Sound
and Vision as a cooperation partner.

Within the media-content industry, video fingerprints are used to track
copyrighted video material. But whereas the industry seeks to police and
control piracy, CADEAH will use similar digital methods to analyse,
research and discuss the cultural dynamics around re-use and remix
of audiovisual heritage and archival footage.
