# Running

Start the Flask application, `python server.py` (requires `flask` to be installed) in one terminal,
and start the React application in another by executing `npm start` in the 
`frontend/video_reuse_detector` directory, after having installed the dependencies of course 
(execute `npm install` in the directory)

Note:
If you execute `pipenv run python -m app.server` from the directory
above this one you can import `video_reuse_detector` in the server-side code.
